# Flask Blog Project

This project is used for my learning of Python and Flask. I will keep track of the steps to build the blog as well as additional notes that I am collecting throughout development.

Build this project based off [Miguel Grinberg's Flask Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).

## Setup

Python Virtual Environments are used to have isolated interpreters. This helps to install packages specifically for each Python application, instead of installing on the system-wide Python interpreter.
To setup a virtual environment in the project's directory:
```
# install venv package

$ sudo apt install python3.10-venv

# create the virtual environment

$ python3 -m venv <name of the vEnvironment>

# activate the virtual environment

$ source venv/bin/activate
```
Install flask on virtual environment.
```
(venv) $ pip install flask
```
